Reticule is a new server, but not a Usenet news server.

It was written by and is copyright (c) 2003, 2004 Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen
<larsi@gnus.org>.  It's released under the GNU General Public License,
a copy of which is included in this package.

Reticule constists of two parts:

1) The frontend, written in C, called Phaeton.  It's a very thin NNRPD
   server that only does the the simple things like serving out
   articles and the like.

2) The backend, written in Lisp, called Reticule.  It does all the
   storage management and stuff.  Users never talk to Reticule directly.

Phaeton requires the following libraries to compile (and I've given the
Debian package names here):

libglib1.2-dev

To run Reticule, you need cmucl.
